# Generative AI Beginner Courseware
---
## 1. Introduction
This courseware is designed for beginners who want to learn about generative AI. It is a collection of tutorials and hands-on exercises that will help you learn how to use generative AI to create new content. The courseware is divided into three parts:
- **Part 1: Introduction to Generative AI** - This part introduces you to Hugging Face's Transformers library and the basics of generative AI. You will learn how to use the library and Hugging Face's pre-trained models to generate text, Text Question answering, Visual Q&A, and image captioning.
- **Part 2: Langchain, VectorDB, RAG and Agents** - This part introduces you to the basics of Langchain, VectorDB, RAG and Agents. You will learn how to use the langchain library for prompting, chaining, and vectorizing text. You will also learn how to use the VectorDB library to vectorize text. you will learn how to use the RAG library to answer question from documents. Finally, you will learn how to use the Agents.
- **Part 3: Further exploration** - This sections is a list of resources that you can use to further explore generative AI.
